<H2><A NAME="mcp_switch">Switching MCP Versions</A></H2>

To switch the MCP to run version <CODE>vx_x_x</CODE>, at the unix
prompt on sdsshost say:
<PRE>
   setup mcp vx_x_x
   switchMCP
</PRE>
then reboot the crate; one convenient way to do this is to start iop
and say
<PRE>
   mcpCrateReset;
</PRE>
another is to use <CODE>^X</CODE> (<CODE>control-X</CODE>) from the mcpMenu.

From within iop, the command <CODE>mcpVersion</CODE> will tell you
the name of the version currently running, the command <CODE>showMCP</CODE>
(from iop or the unix prompt) shows which version will run upon reboot.

<H3>How does this work?</H3>

The vxWorks VME crate doesn't know much about sdsshost; all it knows
is that if you tell it to reboot, it'll read the file
<CODE>/p/mcpbase/etc/mcp.login</CODE> and follow instructions. The
<CODE>switchMCP</CODE> command doesn't attempt to change this behaviour,
rather it changes the files in the <CODE>/p/mcpbase</CODE> directory.
<P>

More specifically, when you say <CODE>switchMCP</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI> All the files under <CODE>/p/mcpbase</CODE> are deleted

<LI> New symbolic links are made from files and directories in
the directory specified by the environment variable <CODE>MCP_DIR</CODE>
to <CODE>/p/mcpbase</CODE> (<CODE>MCP_DIR</CODE> was set when you said
<CODE>setup mcp vx_x_x</CODE>).

These links specify:
<UL>
<LI> mcp.login  The startup script mentioned above

<LI> the object files that make up the MCP

<LI> tables that give the correct values for all the fiducials

<LI> this documentation
</UL>

<LI> <CODE>switchMCP</CODE> also reads the newly installed
<CODE>mcp.login</CODE>
and checks that the correct IP numbers are used for computers such as
<CODE>sdsshost.apo.nmsu.edu</CODE> <CODE>tcc25m.apo.nmsu.edu</CODE>; our
release of vxWorks doesn't know how to use DNS to find these for itself.
